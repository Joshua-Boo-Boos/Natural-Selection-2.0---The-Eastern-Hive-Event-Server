-- ======= NS2.0-TEH-Event: CNBalance/CommMapTools_Shared.lua =======
--
-- SHARED half of two features (loaded on BOTH client and server via a "post" hook on
-- lua/NetworkMessages.lua, so Shared.RegisterNetworkMessage is available):
--
--   1) All-player map PING (default N): any player pings the world spot they are aiming at,
--      once every 5s. Team-mates (only) see a beacon with the pinger's NAME under it in team
--      colour. World-anchored, visible through walls, auto-fades.
--
--   2) Commander map ORDER ICONS: while the commander has the fullscreen map open (C), MMB opens an
--      order wheel, LMB places the selected order icon, RMB clears all icons. Only the commander's
--      OWN team sees them. Each icon shows a small count (top-right) and the order name (below), in
--      green. Icons persist (server-stored) and are replayed to any team-mate who opens their map.
--
-- Everything is done with fire-and-forget NETWORK MESSAGES (not networked entity vars), so this
-- adds ZERO networked classes/vars - it cannot bump the engine's networked-class/var budget.
--
-- Client and server are separate Lua VMs; this file runs in each, so the config table below and
-- the message registrations exist identically on both sides.

-- Shared tuning / constants (same values in both VMs because this one file defines them in both).
