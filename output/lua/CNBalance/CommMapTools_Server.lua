-- ======= NS2.0-TEH-Event: CNBalance/CommMapTools_Server.lua =======
--
-- SERVER half of the ping + commander order-icon features. Loaded via a "post" hook on
-- lua/NS2Gamerules.lua - which loads AFTER NetworkMessages.lua (so the shared file has already
-- registered the messages) and where NS2Gamerules:ResetGame is defined (so wrapping it is safe).
--
-- Responsibilities:
--   * Ping: enforce the 5s-per-player cooldown, then relay the ping to the pinger's TEAM only.
--   * Order icons: accept icon placements / clears from a team's COMMANDER only, keep the
--     authoritative per-team icon list (a plain Lua table - NOT networked vars), relay to the team,
--     and replay the stored icons to any team-mate who opens their map.

if not Server then return end

-- Per-player ping cooldown, keyed by Steam id (survives entity churn). time of last accepted ping.
